    <h4>Essential Strength Training Principles</h4>
    
    <div class="strength-section">
        <h5>1. Progressive Overload</h5>
        <p>Progressive overload is the foundation of strength training. It involves gradually increasing the demands on your muscles to promote growth and strength gains.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase weight gradually</li>
            <li>Add more repetitions</li>
            <li>Decrease rest periods</li>
            <li>Improve exercise form</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strength-section">
        <h5>2. Compound Exercises</h5>
        <p>Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, making them highly efficient for building strength.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Squats for lower body strength</li>
            <li>Deadlifts for posterior chain</li>
            <li>Bench press for upper body</li>
            <li>Overhead press for shoulders</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strength-section">
        <h5>3. Proper Form and Technique</h5>
        <p>Maintaining proper form is crucial for preventing injuries and maximizing results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a neutral spine</li>
            <li>Engage core muscles</li>
            <li>Control the movement</li>
            <li>Breathe properly</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strength-section">
        <h5>4. Training Frequency and Volume</h5>
        <p>Finding the right balance of training frequency and volume is key to progress:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Train each muscle group 2-3 times per week</li>
            <li>Start with 3-4 sets per exercise</li>
            <li>Allow 48-72 hours between sessions</li>
            <li>Adjust volume based on recovery</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h4>Strength Training Fundamentals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on compound movements</li>
            <li>Prioritize proper form</li>
            <li>Allow adequate recovery</li>
            <li>Track your progress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: Consistency and proper technique are more important than lifting heavy weights. Build a strong foundation first, then gradually increase the intensity.</p>
